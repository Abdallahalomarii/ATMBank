- You will see a message asking you to choose the transaction you want to perform.
- I set the balance to `0` to make it easier for you to understand all the functions.
- Initially, you will see your balance as `0`, and you can enter `3` to deposit money.
- After entering `3`, a message will appear asking you to insert the amount you want to add to your balance.
- Press `Enter` to see the new balance.
- Next, you can withdraw money from your balance by pressing `2`.
- A message will prompt you to enter the amount you want to withdraw.
- After entering the amount and pressing `Enter`, you will see your updated balance.
- If you want to check your balance without performing any transactions, press `1`.
- Finally, to exit the ATM app, press `4`. ðŸ˜”
- But wait, here's our last feature! You can view all the transactions you have made by pressing any key, after which the console will disappear.
